Alright. I know this is going to be kind of an aggressive blog post, but I really want to write this (and several other "my problem with.." posts). 

Here's the deal, okay? Microsoft is only focused on what *they* want out of Windows, not what *we* want. And it is so freaking annoying. Part of this reason is that they always want to make it pretty, and new, and add a bunch of things that are supposed to make our quality of life better. But they didn't. I installed a fresh Windows 11 partition on my laptop (keep in mind this is a laptop with a quad-core Intel Core i5 and 8gb of RAM) and I could barely use it. Why, Microsoft? I always have wondered how they could make a OS that was released in 2009 and was prettier than Windows 11. What is it? Oh boy, it's WINDOWS 7! The devs managed to pack so much into that OS, and it could actually run on a Celeron and 4gb of RAM. I absolutely hate how they just threw away that OS and called it a day. If I could only use one OS for the rest of my life,it would be Windows 7. Seriously. Some may find it ugly and obsolete, but when placed in front of Windows 8.1, it is so much better than that Metro theme that literally looks like a 30 year old metro subway. Ugh. But what is instane I have an old laptop lying around, and it came with Windows 10 when I got it.
