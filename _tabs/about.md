# About Me
I don’t know if you have heard of me before, as I am not that popular. But I don’t know, the world is smaller than we think. I created this blog because I have opinions, just like other people. But mine are different. Anyway, I like to code, play piano, go camping, and write. I also like to do other stuff, in case that generic sentence above led you to believe I only do those four things. English is weird. I have touched grass before, in case you were wondering. 

This blog will mainly focus on… random stuff! Yep, you heard that right! I am going to post whatever I feel like on here, and you can’t do **anything** about it! Yay!

Alright, now go read the actual blog.
