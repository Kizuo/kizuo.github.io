Um.. hello? How did you get here? Oh, wait! You visited my blog and clicked the GitHub button to see what it would do. Pesky humans. Always trying to do something. But yeah, you clicked it. You saw my blog repo on my page. And you had to read it. This theme is a pain to set up, but I did it. So stop putting your nosy self inside the blog's code and just get on with your life. Go touch grass. 

If you got stuck here by accident, I am sorry for disrespecting you. Here is the link back to the blog so you can read it: [kizuo.github.io](kizuo.github.io). Ya happy? Now go away. Please.
